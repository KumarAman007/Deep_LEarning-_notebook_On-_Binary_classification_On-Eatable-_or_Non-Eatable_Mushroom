This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify mushrooms as edible or non-edible. 
The goal is to build a reliable binary classification system that can accurately predict whether a mushroom is safe to eat based on various features. 
The dataset used contains information on different mushroom species, 
including features such as cap shape, color, gill size, and more.
